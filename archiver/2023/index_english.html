  		          <span class="word">Deep learning-based segmentation of material microstructure images faces challenges such as scarce samples, annotation difficulty, and model generalization. In material images with complex textures, accurately delineating boundaries between different phases is often challenging. These issues have resulted in poor performance of existing deep learning networks for segmenting material microstructure images. To address these problems, this paper proposes a weakly supervised pseudo-labeling texture segmentation (PTS) network based on line annotation. Compared to full annotation, line annotation only requires labeling a small number of pixels with clear categories, significantly reducing the domain knowledge required for annotation. However, line annotation covers a very small number of pixels, making it difficult to provide sufficient supervision for complex neural networks. Therefore, the PTS network generates pseudo-labels during the training phase to obtain more available supervision.
                  As shown in the figure above, the PTS network adopts a dual-branch structure consisting of a main branch and an auxiliary branch. The main branch is used for feature extraction and segmentation prediction, while the auxiliary branch generates pseudo-labels to assist the training of the main branch, thus achieving dual supervision (line annotation and pseudo-labels) of the segmentation prediction results of the main branch. During the testing phase, only the main branch is used to predict the segmentation results of the images. The PTS network achieves the training of a generalizable image segmentation model for complex textured material images based on one to two line annotations and exhibits universality. The figure below shows the segmentation results based on line annotation for different models on the titanium alloy dataset.</span>

By comparing the feature distributions of the PTS network and the Unet++ network, it can be observed that the different class features in the Unet++ network are more confounded compared to the PTS network. In the figure below, the distributions of blue and orange feature points in the Unet++ network overlap with each other, which may limit the final segmentation results of the Unet++ network. In contrast, the feature distribution of the PTS network exhibits clearer boundaries between different classes, which aids in better predictive segmentation.</span>

In this study, we propose a large-scale information processing method for materials science literature, which involves extracting both textual and tabular information and conducting analysis. Firstly, we propose a material text named entity recognition model that combines general dynamic word vectors with domain-specific static word vectors. Secondly, we present an efficient and accurate method for recognizing and extracting information from image-based tables, specifically extracting material names, units, and components from composition tables. Finally, we utilize the extracted components, processes, properties, and property changes from both text and tables to predict the performance of corrosion resistance, ductility, strength, and hardness using machine learning techniques. This paper demonstrates the methodology using stainless steel as a demonstration material, mining 2.36 million entities and 7,970 compositions from 11,058 stainless steel literature, and predicting four types of performance changes. The proposed method enables large-scale knowledge extraction from materials science literature, and the extracted results can be utilized by relevant researchers to facilitate material performance improvement efforts.</span>

                  <span class="word">The formation of secondary phases in 2205 duplex stainless steel (DSS) has a significant impact on its mechanical properties. The study of the microstructural evolution and coarsening behavior of precipitates in 2205 DSS has scientific and technological significance. In the current work, the composition and morphology evolution of precipitates in 2205 DSS, coarsening for up to 200 hours at 850°C, were systematically investigated using SEM/EDS (Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy) and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) techniques. Additionally, deep learning and digital image processing techniques were employed to perform size statistics on the intermetallic precipitates, particularly the σ phase, based on SEM images. Based on this, the average interfacial energy between the σ phase and γ phase was reasonably estimated using the Ostwald ripening mechanism. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the microstructural evolution and coarsening behavior of precipitates in 2205 DSS.</span>

  		          <span class="word">1. Firstly, this paper explores the automatic extraction of curve information from curve coordinate data commonly found in current scientific literature, addressing the challenges and time-consuming nature of manual extraction. Curve images often exhibit diverse plotting styles, high density, and strong continuity, resulting in inaccurate curve extraction with different methods. This paper proposes an end-to-end curve extraction model based on dense network architecture to address issues such as cluttered and blurred curve lines generated by curve detection methods, aiming to improve the accuracy of curve information extraction. By incorporating adaptive dilated convolution modules to enlarge the receptive field and introducing progressive refinement pathways at each layer, with intermediate outputs being fed into subsequent refinement modules, the network performance is optimized through carefully designed loss function parameters. Additionally, a dedicated dataset for curve detection is constructed, and the improved model is trained to further enhance the ability of the network to extract curve edge information from curve images. The qualitative evaluation results further demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to others.</span>
  		          <br />
  		          <span class="word">2. Furthermore, to address the issues of excessive stacking of dense convolution modules leading to loss of channel feature information, a large number of trainable parameters, and longer training and inference times, this paper proposes a curve extraction network structure based on a dual efficient channel attention mechanism. This method utilizes Vgg as the backbone feature extraction network and employs a dual efficient channel attention mechanism to represent the weights of different channel features, better capturing the relationships between channels in the image and enhancing the ability of feature representation. Subsequently, an embedded stage feature fusion module is introduced to reduce feature loss and enhance feature expression. By fusing low-resolution and high-resolution features from different stages, the model gains a better understanding of the semantic information in the image, while significantly reducing the number of model parameters. Training and testing on a curve dataset demonstrate that the proposed method extracts curve structures with clear contours, well-defined hierarchy, and accurate localization. It effectively addresses the issue of blurred curve boundaries and achieves improved curve extraction accuracy with fewer parameters.</span>
  		          <br />
  		          <span class="word">3. Lastly, the complexity and implementation difficulty of curve data extraction algorithms often limit their application scope. Therefore, the development of user-friendly data extraction software can popularize and facilitate curve data extraction, further promoting its practical application. This paper focuses on the practical value of curve data extraction and develops a desktop data extraction software to facilitate the implementation of the algorithm. This software allows more people to benefit from the practical value of curve data extraction and promotes its widespread application in various fields.</span>

A context-aware literature information extraction method is proposed based on the expression characteristics of material literature texts and the structural features of component tables, which mines both text and table information. Named entity recognition (NER) technology is used to mine material texts by fusing dynamic word vectors with static word vectors in the material field, so that each word vector contains contextual information and material domain knowledge, significantly improving the NER effect of material texts. Experiments were conducted on NER datasets of stainless steel materials and inorganic materials. </span>

A material performance prediction method based on literature information extraction is proposed to predict the tensile strength and material composition data obtained from the context of material literature. The method utilizes the XenonPy materials informatics library to expand the feature space of the composition data. Based on the expansion principle, a cross-feature compression and feature selection method is designed to screen for statistically significant element-level features and tensile strength data. Machine learning is then used to train the prediction model on these data. The experiment uses data published by the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan, and the results show that the proposed composition feature processing method can significantly improve the prediction performance of the model.</span>

                <span class="word">1. She proposed an image enhancement-based method for recognizing the morphology characteristics of thermal barrier coatings. The method consists of three steps: enhancement of pore contours and image denoising, pore removal and crack repair, and crack recognition and length calculation. It can successfully identify cracks in thermal barrier coatings. Additionally, the reasonable use of image filtering and mathematical morphology enhancement methods ensures high integrity and low deviation in crack recognition in thermal barrier coatings. The proposed method can automatically identify cracks in thermal barrier coatings and calculate their lengths. Compared to manual detection, this method provides more precise crack recognition and faster crack length calculation, providing effective assistance to material science researchers in analyzing the microstructure of thermal barrier coatings conveniently and efficiently.</span>
                <br />
                <span class="word">2. She designed two software programs for identifying the morphology characteristics of thermal barrier coatings. One software program achieves thermal barrier coating image enhancement and crack skeleton extraction, while the other software program achieves crack recognition and length calculation. The combination of both software programs further improves the speed of analyzing the microstructure of thermal barrier coatings, reducing time and labor costs. Moreover, the software can also process other material images similar to thermal barrier coating images, promoting the research and development of material science.</span>

                <span class="word">3. She proposed a method for material image data augmentation using an improved HP-VAE-GAN. The improved HP-VAE-GAN uses a CBAM module to refine feature mapping and improve the network's feature representation ability. Meanwhile, an additional convolutional block was added to the encoder network to further improve the network's feature extraction ability and eliminate the impact of CBAM insertion on model performance. The generated results show that the proposed HP-VAE-GAN with the CBAM attention mechanism can effectively improve the quality of generated images. The results of classification experiments show that this method achieves better results than using HP-VAE-GAN for data augmentation, providing a new data augmentation approach for small sample material image datasets.</span>

                <span class="word">1. Extraction of Numerical Chart Information: A combined image and text-based literature mining method was proposed for extracting information from numerical charts along with their corresponding titles. The method involves several steps. Firstly, Yolov5s is utilized to extract individual numerical chart images from scientific literature, and an improved scientific literature image detection method is employed to enhance accuracy. Next, the PDFminer tool is used to parse the textual content from the scientific literature. The cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity between sentences are calculated to match the textual titles corresponding to the numerical charts. The Sci-Bert model and CRF algorithm are then applied to identify axis names in the titles. Additionally, techniques such as morphological operations and character recognition are used to extract specific data information from the numerical chart images. Finally, the extracted axis names and data are integrated to obtain complete numerical chart information.</span>
                <br />
                <span class="word">2. In order to address the low accuracy issue in recognizing axis names of numerical charts mentioned above, this study focuses on the relationship between numerical chart images and text in scientific literature and proposes a method to improve recognition performance. The method starts by identifying label text on the numerical chart image and filling it into a sample template to generate unlabeled text data, effectively achieving data augmentation. Additionally, text similarity matching techniques are employed to search for corresponding statements describing the numerical charts in the body of the scientific literature. These statements are then concatenated with the title text to expand the textual context, improving the vector representation of the generated input sentences. This optimization aims to enhance the predictive performance of the model.</span>

Xia Jinhua had the privilege of meeting many excellent mentors and friends. We hope that Xia Jinhua will always remember their original aspirations and mission, overcome challenges, and forge ahead on their future path with determination.</span>

The structure and orientation information of crystals can be obtained by analyzing the Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) patterns, which are acquired through EBSD devices. The reliability and accuracy of the obtained information depend on the precise localization of EBSD pattern bands and intersection points. In this research, a method is proposed that combines Radon transform and cumulative probability Hough transform to achieve automatic localization of EBSD patterns (Chirikov bands) and intersection points. Experimental results demonstrate that this method is robust and capable of detecting more accurate Chirikov bands and intersection points.</span>

To address the challenge of balancing annotation cost and segmentation accuracy in material image segmentation tasks and achieve real-time segmentation models, a material image segmentation algorithm based on interactive drawing annotation and machine learning is designed. The primary objective of this method is to obtain segmentation models in real-time. It involves extracting neighborhood features around the center points of material images and performing multiple rounds of interactive drawing annotation. An incremental learning approach is utilized to train the final image segmentation model. This approach enables the model to continuously improve and adapt to new data while minimizing the annotation effort required.</span>

                <span class="word">3. To achieve high-precision segmentation models based on limited and easily accessible annotated data, a weakly supervised deep learning method for material image segmentation is designed, which relies on pseudo-labeling. The objective of this method is to obtain optimal segmentation results based on limited annotated data. A novel dual-branch network architecture is designed, and a new context feature discrepancy supervision loss is proposed to generate pseudo-labels. This allows the model to achieve high segmentation accuracy using only training images annotated with scribbles. This method addresses the challenges of small sample sizes, annotation difficulties, and resource wastage during testing in deep learning neural networks for material image segmentation tasks.</span>

In this research, a novel video processing method is proposed to extract and analyze information data from videos depicting the transformation of lamellar martensite. The analysis of image data provides the following dynamic information about the transformation of lamellar martensite: the number of transformations, maximum length, maximum width, average length, average width, area, and category orientation. This study breaks the limitations of studying martensite based on static images and comprehensively describes various data and information related to the dynamic transformation of martensite.</span>

Existing methods can effectively segment images of specific scenes, but there is no universal approach to accurately segment and analyze material images. To address the challenges of complex textures, blurry boundaries, and low contrast in material images, we propose a method that relies on multi-dimensional feature fusion to more effectively train networks with limited and available annotated samples. This architecture consists of an encoder, graph attention module, multi-scale feature fusion module, and decoder. We demonstrate that such a network can be trained end-to-end from images. In electron microscopy images, the segmentation results outperform many previous state-of-the-art methods. With this approach, we can accurately identify multiple structures in material images, providing valuable insights for multi-stage segmentation of material images and exploring new mechanisms for structural transformations in materials science.</span>
