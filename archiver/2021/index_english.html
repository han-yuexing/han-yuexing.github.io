                <span class="word">The 5th Materials Genome Engineering Summit was held in Zhengzhou, Henan, from December 14th to 16th, 2021. On the afternoon of December 16th, Professor Han Yuexing delivered a presentation titled "Material Image Processing Methods Based on Computer Vision." He described several methods for extracting information from material image data.
                  Material data serves as the foundation of the Materials Genome Initiative and plays a crucial role in constructing various databases related to material research. It also aids in the understanding of the relationships between "microstructure," "manufacturing processes," and "macroscopic properties" for artificial intelligence. Material data primarily consists of computational data, experimental data, production data, and literature data, with a significant amount of images often included within these datasets. Extracting key information from these images is a primary objective of material image processing.</span>
                <br />                 
                <span class="word">The presentation mainly described the use of computer vision methods, including machine learning and deep learning techniques, to extract and analyze various elements within complex material images. Three specific examples were discussed:
                  1. Recognition of DNA macromolecules in images of molecular robots: This example focused on using computer vision methods to identify and recognize DNA macromolecules in images of molecular robots. By applying machine learning algorithms, the system can automatically extract and analyze the structures and patterns of DNA molecules, contributing to the understanding and design of molecular machines.
                  2. Segmentation and recognition of Kikuchi patterns: The second example involved the segmentation and recognition of Kikuchi patterns. By employing image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms, the system can accurately identify and segment Kikuchi patterns, which are essential for analyzing crystal structures and orientations.
                  3. Material image segmentation using superpixels and improved DenseNet: The third example discussed material image segmentation using a combination of superpixels and an improved DenseNet method. By utilizing superpixels to group image regions and incorporating an enhanced DenseNet architecture, the system can effectively segment materials in images, providing valuable insights for material analysis and characterization.
                  These examples demonstrate the application of computer vision techniques, including machine learning and deep learning, in extracting and analyzing important information from complex material images.</span>

  			        <span class="word">In order to assist doctors in making comprehensive assessments and plans for tumor patients, automated segmentation of the liver and tumors in CT images is performed using various deep learning techniques. This provides a data foundation for quantitative and qualitative diagnosis, facilitating clinical treatment. Automated segmentation of the liver and tumors using a combination of deep learning techniques allows doctors to obtain comprehensive evaluations and treatment plans for tumor patients. This automated approach alleviates the workload on doctors and improves the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. By utilizing deep learning algorithms, the system can learn and recognize the features of the liver and tumors in CT images, accurately segmenting them. Such segmentation results can be used for quantitative and qualitative assessments, aiding in clinical decision-making.</span>

			          <span class="word">1. A boundary loss-based 2.5D fully convolutional network (FCN) is proposed to address the limitations of FCN, U-Net, and other deep learning methods in exploring spatial feature information in three-dimensional CT images. This novel approach effectively explores the spatial feature information in CT images while reducing the network parameters and computational resource consumption. The proposed method enhances the accuracy of liver and liver tumor segmentation.</span>
  			        <br />
  			        <span class="word">2. To address the characteristics of medical images and the limited capability of common loss functions to optimize network exploration of boundary features, a new boundary loss function is designed. This novel loss function combines the distance, area, and boundary information of image contours, effectively optimizing deep learning networks to explore more image boundary and contour features.</span>
			          <br />
			          <span class="word">3. To address the issue of encoding-decoding networks ignoring the correlation and dependency among local features, a segmentation framework based on dual-path attention is proposed by integrating 2D, 2.5D, and 3D networks with attention mechanisms. This framework incorporates dual-path self-attention modules, dense network blocks, residual network blocks, and dual-path network blocks. It comprises nine different network structures and is capable of effectively performing automated segmentation of liver and tumor CT images. The integration of these components allows the network to capture and leverage both local and global information, leading to improved segmentation accuracy.</span>

To address this issue, we have designed a novel method for identifying nano-objects in atomic force microscopy (AFM) images.
                  Firstly, we employ a LOG-based image denoising technique for preprocessing the images. Then, we propose two improved methods for segmenting overlapping objects based on the watershed algorithm. Finally, we establish a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) recognition model. This model achieves excellent performance by pretraining on large-scale datasets of handwritten digits and letter shapes, enabling the identification of nano-objects in AFM images.
                  The method proposed in this study effectively tackles the challenge of identifying nano-objects in AFM images, where the availability of small-sample nano-objects is limited.</span>

However, its application to EEG (Electroencephalogram) motor imagery signal classification has been limited. In this study, we propose a preprocessing algorithm for representing EEG signals, followed by a parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN) architecture for classifying motor imagery signals.
                  For the representation of raw EEG signals, a novel form of image is created to combine spatial filtering and frequency band extraction. By inputting the represented images into the PCNN, it stacks three unique sub-models together, aiming to optimize the classification performance.
                  The proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 83.0±3.4% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b, surpassing the compared methods by at least 5.2%. The average Kappa value of this method on Dataset 2b reaches 0.659±0.067, exhibiting at least a 20.5% improvement compared to the compared algorithms. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in classifying motor imagery signals in EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.</span>

			          <span class="word">High-throughput (HTP) methods have emerged as powerful approaches for accelerating materials research and development. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of combining machine learning (ML) image segmentation techniques with HTP synthesis and characterization for the discovery of new thermoelectric compounds. 
                  First, cylindrical samples with nine different compositions were synthesized using an improved diffusion couple HTP synthesis method. Subsequently, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization was performed on fixed fragments of each composition, resulting in the acquisition of 11 backscattered electron (BSE) images per fragment (99 images in total). To rapidly segment the different phases in the 99 BSE images, we propose two ML image segmentation strategies: a supervised active learning strategy utilizing a fully connected neural network and an unsupervised clustering strategy. 
                  The supervised strategy significantly reduces the time cost of image segmentation, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.9. This model is then used for automatic segmentation of a large batch of images. To further reduce the workload of manual annotation, active learning is introduced during the training process. Analyzing the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) characterization of the two major phases separated by the first strategy, we discovered a new compound, Cu7Sn3S10, which exhibits promising thermoelectric properties with a zT value exceeding 0.6. 
                  In contrast to the supervised strategy, the unsupervised strategy allows for the identification of compounds that may have been overlooked in the BSE images without manual annotation. Based on the results of the unsupervised strategy, we discovered an unreported compound, Cu1.6S. Overall, our work showcases an example of a fully HTP workflow, enabling automated analysis of HTP characterization and new compound identification.</span>

                <span class="word">Counterfeit products, ranging from high-end luxury goods to medical supplies, not only cause significant economic losses but also pose a significant threat to people's health. The currently widely used anti-counterfeiting labels are based on deterministic production processes, which are simple to replicate for counterfeiters. Developing anti-counterfeiting labels with physical unclonable functions (PUFs) is a feasible solution. However, traditional PUF recognition techniques require matching against all images in a database, resulting in high production costs and slow identification speed.</span>
                <br />  
                <span class="word">To address the aforementioned issues, the research team utilized high-throughput parallel non-continuous dewetting technology to fabricate a multifunctional label with four layers of anti-counterfeiting capabilities. 
                  The first layer of anti-counterfeiting is achieved through the fluorescence of perovskite crystal films. These films exhibit unique fluorescence properties that can be used for authentication. The second layer of anti-counterfeiting involves macroscopic patterns composed of basic units, such as QR codes, which can carry information and serve as additional security features.
                  The third layer of anti-counterfeiting is based on microscale basic units with diverse shapes. These units provide an additional level of security as their distinct shapes can be difficult to replicate.
                  The fourth layer of anti-counterfeiting is achieved through the use of non-reproducible textures formed through self-assembly processes. These random textures create a unique and unclonable pattern, further enhancing the security of the label. By combining these four layers of anti-counterfeiting features, the research team has developed a label that offers enhanced security and counterfeit prevention across multiple levels.</span>
                <br />  
                <span class="word">Our main work involved designing and establishing a database that stores authentic thin film patterns, which includes shape and texture databases. For shape recognition, we employed the CNL (Control the Number of Landmarks) method, an improved Hough Transform method, and shape space theory. These techniques were utilized to accurately identify the shapes present in the labels.
                  Subsequently, we utilized the GMS (Grid-based Motion Statistics) method to further recognize the textures of the labels. This method leverages grid-based analysis and motion statistics to effectively identify and differentiate the unique textures embedded in the labels.
                  By combining the shape recognition techniques and texture identification using GMS, our research team has developed a comprehensive approach for the recognition and authentication of the labels based on their shape and texture characteristics.</span>
                <br />  
                <span class="word">In practical applications, anti-counterfeiting micro-patterns are captured using smartphones or portable microscopes and then fed into recognition software for matching and identification. The various contour shapes of the nanocrystal films are refined and classified, serving as "classification symbols" for image data recognition. By employing this "divide and conquer" strategy in the recognition process, the verification time can be reduced by more than 20 times.
                  Combining high-throughput materials fabrication techniques with data-driven material applications, our approach achieves low reagent costs (2.1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> USD), simple and fast authentication (total time of 12.17 seconds), and high coding capacity (2.1 × 10<sup>623</sup>).
                  This integration of advanced technologies enables cost-effective and efficient anti-counterfeiting measures, providing a robust solution with high coding capacity and fast authentication for a wide range of applications.</span>
