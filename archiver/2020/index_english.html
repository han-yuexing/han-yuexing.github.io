                <span class="word">The Hall-Petch relationship provides a quantitative description of the relationship between grain size and yield strength in polycrystalline materials. However, there are various statistical methods for determining grain size, such as intercept method, matching method, and grid method. Additionally, concepts of grain size can be represented by parameters such as equivalent circle diameter and grain perimeter. Investigating the geometric characteristics of grains that have the highest correlation with yield strength in polycrystalline materials requires image and big data processing.
                  This study combines image processing and machine learning techniques to construct the relationship between geometric characteristics of magnesium alloy grains and yield strength.</span>
