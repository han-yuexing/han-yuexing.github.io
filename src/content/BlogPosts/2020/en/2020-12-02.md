Looking back at the past year, the research group led by Han Yanxing has achieved remarkable results in scientific research, with numerous successful projects and a record number of high-quality papers accepted. The group has always been guided by the goal of serving the country, staying abreast of cutting-edge research, and striving for academic excellence. This would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of each member of the research group and the strong support from the university and department. As we look towards the future, the road ahead may be long, but the research group will continue to fear no challenges, explore new academic frontiers, and each member will walk hand in hand, striving together to reach new heights in research. It is through facing difficulties that true courage is revealed, and it is through honing our skills that we can achieve success!
