Our team published the paper "A projection module based on the shape space theory for small-sample image processing". The School of Computer Engineering and Science of Shanghai University is the first unit of the paper.

The "pre-training" plus "fine-tuning" paradigm provides an effective tool for neural network image processing with limited datasets. This approach compensates for the lack of information in small target datasets by pre-training models on large source datasets. However, when the target dataset is further reduced to a small sample size, the existing method is difficult to maintain the performance of the migration model, resulting in a sharp deterioration of the effect. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes PMSS, a projection module based on shape space theory, to enhance the capability of migration models in small sample scenarios.

We first pre-train the model on the source dataset and save it, and subsequently extract features from the target dataset using the pre-trained model. These features, which are originally in Euclidean space, are projected to the pre-shape space for subsequent training via PMSS. In addition, a class-aware attention mechanism is introduced during the learning process to enhance the model's ability to handle small-sample tasks through enhanced feature representation. Extensive experiments on 10 backbone networks and 5 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PMSS: 6%, 8%, and 13% accuracy improvements are achieved on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and their small-sample subsets, respectively.PMSS adopts a plug-and-play design, which allows it to be directly applied to real-world finite-data systems without the need to change the network architecture. PMSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on small-sample tasks compared to the latest stream learning methods and robust migration learning methods.
