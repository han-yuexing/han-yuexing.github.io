In today's ongoing pandemic situation, wearing masks has become a common practice during outings, which obstructs the nose and mouth regions of the face. Additionally, common facial occlusion scenarios include wearing sunglasses, hats, or objects casting shadows on the face. Facial occlusion poses challenges for facial expression recognition. In this paper, based on three common facial occlusion scenarios, namely upper-face occlusion, lower-face occlusion, and eye occlusion, we propose a path selection-based multi-network structure. The method consists of two parts: the first part involves a multi-network structure, where the original dataset is divided into three subsets based on labels, referred to as sub-datasets. Each sub-dataset inherits some labels from the original dataset and is used to train three corresponding sub-networks. The second part is a path selection-based multi-network integration method, where images from each sub-dataset, treated as the same label, are combined into a new dataset for training an initial network. The final prediction is obtained by selecting one of the sub-networks based on the prediction output of the initial network. In this study, the Fer2013, Jaffe, KDEF, and RAF-DB datasets, commonly used for facial expression recognition, are merged into a larger dataset to increase the training sample size and simulate occlusion scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively recognizes facial expressions under occlusion and is applicable to various facial occlusion scenarios, enabling more accurate and reliable facial expression recognition in a wide range of real-world applications.
