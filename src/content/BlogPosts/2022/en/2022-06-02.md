The microscopic structure of material images often exhibits diverse shapes, complex textures, and blurred boundaries. These characteristics have posed limitations on the development of deep learning methods in the field of material image processing. In this study, we propose Graph-UNet, which combines the UNet architecture with graph convolutional neural networks to address the challenge of automatic segmentation of small-sample material images. We transfer the ideas of multidimensional feature fusion and skip connections from convolutional neural networks to graph convolutional neural networks, enabling an effective combination of graph convolutions and graph attention. Additionally, we establish a versatile module to facilitate the conversion between feature maps and graph structures. Comparative and ablation experiments were conducted on material image datasets, demonstrating that Graph-UNet outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation results. It accurately identifies various material structures, thereby advancing the exploration of the relationship between material structure and performance.
