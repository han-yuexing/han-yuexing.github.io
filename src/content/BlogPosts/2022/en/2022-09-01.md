      <p>Nice to meet you, Hu Gan! It's great to have you as a doctoral student in the 2022 cohort at Shanghai University's School of Computer Science. With a background in computer-related majors for both your undergraduate and master's degrees from Anhui University of Science and Technology, you bring valuable knowledge and expertise to the research group. Your introverted nature and fewer words are perfectly fine, and it's wonderful to hear that you have a fun and playful side once you feel comfortable around others. Ping pong and running are fantastic hobbies that keep you active and energized. Playing games like "League of Legends" with friends sounds like a great way to relax and enjoy some fun moments, even if you don't have all the skins due to skin changer restrictions. Being in a new environment at Shanghai University, we're confident that you'll have new experiences and make significant progress. It's a fantastic opportunity to meet interesting people and continuously improve yourself. We wish you a successful and fulfilling journey throughout your doctoral studies, and may you graduate smoothly in the end!</p>
