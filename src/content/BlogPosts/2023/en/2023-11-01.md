Scientific literature serves as an important means of showcasing research outcomes. In this study, we propose a large-scale information processing method for materials science literature, which involves extracting both textual and tabular information and conducting analysis. Firstly, we propose a material text named entity recognition model that combines general dynamic word vectors with domain-specific static word vectors. Secondly, we present an efficient and accurate method for recognizing and extracting information from image-based tables, specifically extracting material names, units, and components from composition tables. Finally, we utilize the extracted components, processes, properties, and property changes from both text and tables to predict the performance of corrosion resistance, ductility, strength, and hardness using machine learning techniques. This paper demonstrates the methodology using stainless steel as a demonstration material, mining 2.36 million entities and 7,970 compositions from 11,058 stainless steel literature, and predicting four types of performance changes. The proposed method enables large-scale knowledge extraction from materials science literature, and the extracted results can be utilized by relevant researchers to facilitate material performance improvement efforts.
