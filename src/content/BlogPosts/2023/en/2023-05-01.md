With the development and integration of multiple disciplines, the fusion of computer vision and materials science has greatly transformed conventional material research methods. Existing methods can effectively segment images of specific scenes, but there is no universal approach to accurately segment and analyze material images. To address the challenges of complex textures, blurry boundaries, and low contrast in material images, we propose a method that relies on multi-dimensional feature fusion to more effectively train networks with limited and available annotated samples. This architecture consists of an encoder, graph attention module, multi-scale feature fusion module, and decoder. We demonstrate that such a network can be trained end-to-end from images. In electron microscopy images, the segmentation results outperform many previous state-of-the-art methods. With this approach, we can accurately identify multiple structures in material images, providing valuable insights for multi-stage segmentation of material images and exploring new mechanisms for structural transformations in materials science.
