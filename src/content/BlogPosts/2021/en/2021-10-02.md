Deep learning has been widely successful in various image classification tasks. However, its application to EEG (Electroencephalogram) motor imagery signal classification has been limited. In this study, we propose a preprocessing algorithm for representing EEG signals, followed by a parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN) architecture for classifying motor imagery signals. For the representation of raw EEG signals, a novel form of image is created to combine spatial filtering and frequency band extraction. By inputting the represented images into the PCNN, it stacks three unique sub-models together, aiming to optimize the classification performance. The proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 83.0±3.4% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b, surpassing the compared methods by at least 5.2%. The average Kappa value of this method on Dataset 2b reaches 0.659±0.067, exhibiting at least a 20.5% improvement compared to the compared algorithms. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in classifying motor imagery signals in EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.
