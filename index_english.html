	  		        <span class="word">In materials science and biomedical fields. Current academic database tools mainly focus on mining textual information, ignoring the valuable information presented in graphs and charts. Extracting information from a large amount of literature can help researchers quickly grasp the current state of development. Literature is a carrier of many forms of data, and most researchers focus only on textual content. Especially, like graphs, they contain a lot of key numerical information that is not expressed in other data. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting information from graphs in the literature. With this method, the numerical values and axis entities of curved graphs can be extracted from both graphs and text. Firstly, the curved graphs are cut out from the literature using Yolov5s. Then, the exact title text corresponding to each curve graph is matched by manipulating Sentence-Bert. After obtaining the title text, the X-axis and Y-axis names in the curve graphs were extracted using SCI-Bert. At the same time, techniques such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to automatically parse the numerical data reflected on the graphs. In addition, a number of principles are used to improve performance. We validated each step using a dataset of 6042 articles from Elsevier. With our method, the accuracy of graph detection and title matching are 96.4% and 95.8% respectively, which are both better than the initial model, proving the effectiveness of our method. The accuracy of entity and numerical data extraction is 76.3% and 28.2%, respectively. The experimental results show that our method is able to achieve large-scale knowledge extraction of curve diagrams from the literature.</span>

To address the issues of small sample size and complex microstructure features in material image semantic segmentation, a dual branch semantic segmentation network based on feature pyramid and cross attention is proposed. This network is divided into main branch and auxiliary branch. The main branch uses a feature pyramid model to aggregate multi-level image features to enhance detail information; The auxiliary branch uses low-level features of the backbone network to segment images, and the auxiliary network learns texture and boundary information. Under the collaboration of multi task supervision and multi-scale features, this method achieves the best performance on multiple small sample material image datasets compared to the comparative model. </span>

To address the significant issue of small sample size in material image instance segmentation, a instance segmentation method based on multimodal fusion and pseudo labeling technology is proposed to improve the utilization of existing data. This method improves the accuracy of object classification, localization, and segmentation by fusing multimodal data of images and text. This paper divides training into two stages: fully supervised training and semi supervised training. During the semi supervised training phase, pseudo labeling techniques are used to involve unlabeled data in the optimization of the supervised model. Under the collaboration of multimodal information and two-stage training, compared to the comparison model, this method achieves superior performance in various small sample instance segmentation scenarios. </span>

Aiming at the characteristics of limited available data and insufficient diversity in small sample image scenes, a feature enhancement method based on pre shape space geodesic curves, abbreviated as FAGC-PSS (Feature Augmentation on Geodetic Curves in Pre Shape Space), is proposed. Firstly, use deep learning models to extract features from small sample images; Enhance the dimensionality of image features based on shape space theory and project them onto a pre shape space; Construct corresponding geodesic curves for each category of feature data separately; Finally, generate feature data along the optimal geodesic curve for training the image processing model. The innovation of this method includes the following three points: firstly, achieving small sample image feature enhancement, which helps the model comprehensively understand the distribution and rules of training samples, and improves the robustness and reliability of the model; Secondly, the proposed FAGC-PSS feature enhancement method can be applied to multiple downstream tasks, such as achieving good results when combined with machine learning classification models; Thirdly, designing a random probability function and influencing factors in the cross entropy loss function of small sample image classification tasks can balance the impact of generated features and image features on the model.</span>

In response to the characteristics of small sample size and poor prediction accuracy of material properties in material images, this paper proposes a material property prediction method based on FAGC-PSS. This method achieves material performance prediction tasks on small sample material images by designing the downstream task framework structure of FAGC-PSS and combining it with a pseudo labeling mechanism. The specific process includes four steps: extracting material image features, generating features through FAGC-PSS, using pseudo labeling mechanism to label performance value labels for the generated features, and finally using enhanced features to train the material performance prediction model. The innovation of this method includes the following: introducing the FAGC-PSS module into the predictive material performance model to enhance the diversity and complexity of feature data; Design a pseudo labeling mechanism to annotate the generated feature data. The experimental results show that this method can demonstrate good effectiveness and universality for predicting the properties of different types of materials. </span>

	  		        <span class="word">Predicting material image performance based on deep learning faces challenges such as data scarcity, inability to simultaneously extract local and global features of material images, and discovering correlations between features. In the field of materials, due to factors such as manufacturing costs and commercial protection, it is not possible to obtain data in bulk like obtaining natural scene images, which makes it difficult to directly apply deep learning models to the materials field due to insufficient data volume. On the other hand, unlike natural scene images, material images often have very fine and complex texture structures due to their own characteristics, and macroscopic performance is not only affected by local microscopic structures. The correlation between features and the interaction between structures, that is, global features, are also very important. Most existing deep learning methods often directly apply CNN models that perform well on natural scene images to the field of materials without targeted optimization. Due to the fixed size of the convolution kernel, CNN's receptive field is limited and often only extracts local features of the image, ignoring global features. Therefore, the algorithm suffers from insufficient training due to the scarcity of data and the inability to simultaneously extract local and global features, resulting in insufficient prediction accuracy and poor robustness. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dual structure feature extraction and multi-scale attention fusion network (RCFNet). This model adopts a dual branch structure of global feature extraction module and local feature extraction module, independently extracting global and local features of material images without damaging the original modeling of their respective features. By proposing a multi-scale attention fusion module (Merge), the global and local features extracted at each scale are fused, and the fusion module accumulates information from the previous fusion result. The final fused features are fed into FCNN for processing and prediction results are obtained. The following is a schematic diagram of the structure of the multi-scale attention fusion module.</span>

Next, global features with global semantics are further processed through channel attention mechanisms, while local features with local semantic information are further processed through spatial attention mechanisms. Subsequently, high-dimensional spatial mapping and nonlinear transformation are performed to obtain the fusion result of the current stage. The proposed method takes into account both local and global feature extraction of material images, with the Merge module performing multi-level feature fusion, multi attention continuously focusing on key features, suppressing noise information, reducing information loss, and reducing the model's dependence on a large amount of training data. In the field of material images with scarce samples, very impressive prediction results have also been obtained.</span>

                  At present, the tensile strength of Al Si alloys is mainly obtained through tensile testing, which involves sample preparation, processing, and testing, requiring professional skills and testing equipment. There are problems such as long testing cycles, high costs, and material waste. In addition, preparing standardized tensile specimens for performance testing is a challenge for components with complex shapes. Therefore, how to efficiently and accurately obtain the tensile strength of materials is currently a challenging problem.
                  To address this issue, an innovative multimodal fusion learning framework that comprehensively considers composition and microstructure is proposed to predict the tensile strength of Al Si alloys. This work focuses on hypoeutectic Al Si alloys with wide applications. Firstly, we collected data from literature and experimental data on different modes, including alloy composition, added alloy elements, α - Al images, eutectic Si images, tensile sample size, and tensile rate. Secondly, using image processing techniques to extract microstructural feature parameters, the image is segmented and quantitatively analyzed. Then, a three-step feature screening was performed on 33 features from different modalities to obtain 12 key features. Finally, using 12 key features as inputs, four machine learning models (Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) were employed to construct a regression prediction model for tensile strength. The results showed that the XGBoost model performed the best among all models, achieving high accuracy in predicting tensile strength (R2=0.94, relative error less than 8.1%, absolute error less than 14.2 MPa) with limited data mainly from different literature. In addition, five mixed features (Grain size, Ti, Si, ECD, Number density) that significantly affect UTS and their critical values were identified through feature importance analysis and SHAP analysis. This work is expected to provide insights into the mapping relationship between the composition, microstructure, and properties of hypoeutectic Al Si alloys, and can be applied to other alloys.
