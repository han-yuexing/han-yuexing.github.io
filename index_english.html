A lightweight deep learning method based on unimodal feature decoupling is proposed to solve the task of predicting the authenticity of calcite PUF anti-counterfeiting labels in view of the complexity of multilevel features in functional material images. The feature decoupling strategy separates the learning of macroscopic and microscopic features into independent stages, which reduces the interference between different layers of features. To meet the high efficiency and low latency requirements, a lightweight divergent convolution network is designed, whose core divergent convolution mechanism significantly reduces the computational complexity. At the same time, the extra angle boundary loss function is used to enhance the discriminative ability of the features by increasing the inter-class distance and reducing the intra-class differences. In order to achieve effective rejection of unknown samples, a geodesic metric is proposed to predict the sample authenticity based on the geodesic distance in high-dimensional manifold space.</span>

Aiming at the problem of difficult fusion of multimodal heterogeneous data features of functional materials, a lightweight deep learning method based on multimodal feature fusion is proposed to solve the task of predicting the properties of calcium alginate/graphene composites. By designing a table-driven feature fusion network, two heterogeneous data sources, namely image and table, are effectively integrated. The network contains two core modules: form-guided visual semantic enhancement module and gated feature fusion module. The table-guided visual semantic enhancement module uses table information to guide visual feature learning for deep cross-modal alignment and enhancement; the gated feature fusion module performs effective inter-modal interaction, alignment and adaptive weighted fusion through cross-attention and gating mechanisms. Meanwhile, to ensure computational efficiency, the network adopts lightweight design such as shunt convolution and Mamba.</span>

                <span class="word">1. An image generation method based on the migration of information from pre-shaped spatial geodesic surfaces is proposed to address the challenges faced by image generation models when there are too few training samples and a lack of applicable pre-training models. The method overcomes the bottleneck of the model's difficulty in effectively learning the distribution of very few samples and aims to generate high-quality and diverse images. The core process is as follows: firstly, the depth features of a small number of samples are extracted and used to construct a geodesic surface in pre-shape space for nonlinear feature enhancement; then, a pseudo-source domain is constructed based on the enhanced features to simulate a rich data distribution, and information migration from the pseudo-source domain to the target domain is carried out; finally, interpolated supervisory and regularisation constraints are imposed at the information migration stage for optimisation. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, this method significantly improves the quality, detail richness and diversity of the generated images on multi-domain datasets, effectively mitigates pattern collapse, and demonstrates the potential of its generated images in assisting downstream tasks.</span>
                <br />
                <span class="word">2. To address the challenges of the text-guided zero-sample image style migration task, a zero-sample style migration method based on the enhancement of geodesic surface features in the pre-shape space is proposed. The method aims to efficiently inject external novel style information into the pre-trained model while ensuring style consistency and content accuracy. Specifically, the method applies the idea of geodesic feature enhancement to the style migration framework based on the pre-trained diffusion model, combines with sliding window cropping to process the local information, and facilitates the effective fusion of the style and content features in the pre-shape space using the geodesic feature enhancement module. Experiments show that the method can achieve flexible text-guided style control without additional model fine-tuning or style references, and can better maintain the original content structure when generating images with the target style compared to the comparison model.</span>

Aiming at the problems of long sequence dependency and complex entity relationships in materials literature, a semantically enhanced graph network model is proposed and applied to the literature mining field of composite materials. The model enhances semantic association modelling by constructing a heterogeneous graph and introduces a chunked attention mechanism to efficiently deal with the long sequence problem, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional models. On this basis, the model uses deep separable convolution to fuse global and local semantic features, and combines the dynamic edge weighting mechanism and deep scoring network to improve the node representation and recognition accuracy, and more effectively captures the semantic relationships of material terms in complex contexts.</span>

In order to exploit the potential of large language models for entity extraction in scientific literature scenarios, a context-consistent explicit entity annotation method with a two-stage training approach is proposed to address the discrepancy between the generative output of the large language model and the sequential annotation characteristics of the named entity recognition task. Then, the training phase is divided into two phases: supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimisation. The supervised fine-tuning phase first learns the basic entity recognition ability on the existing annotation data; the direct preference optimisation phase tries to expand and contract the entity boundaries in negative sample construction in order to guide the model to correct the errors more efficiently, and screens the reasoning results of supervised fine-tuning to create category confusing samples, and enhances the model to respond to the errors by utilising the positive and negative samples pairs of preference difference to constrain and enhance the model's ability to correct erroneous determinations.</span>

The effectiveness of the method is verified experimentally for complex specialised texts in the fields of materials science and biomedicine. Finally, the method is applied to specific fields and three kinds of high hardness alloys are designed to show its practical value in scientific text mining and assisting R&D decision-making.</span>

This approach compensates for the lack of information in small target datasets by pre-training models on large source datasets. However, when the target dataset is further reduced to a small sample size, the existing method is difficult to maintain the performance of the migration model, resulting in a sharp deterioration of the effect. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes PMSS, a projection module based on shape space theory, to enhance the capability of migration models in small sample scenarios.</span>

In addition, a class-aware attention mechanism is introduced during the learning process to enhance the model's ability to handle small-sample tasks through enhanced feature representation. Extensive experiments on 10 backbone networks and 5 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PMSS: 6%, 8%, and 13% accuracy improvements are achieved on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and their small-sample subsets, respectively.PMSS adopts a plug-and-play design, which allows it to be directly applied to real-world finite-data systems without the need to change the network architecture.

By incorporating materials domain knowledge into the data analysis, we identified high-potential elements and critical process conditions to guide the design and construction of machine learning datasets. After manually summarizing and organizing the target literature, we constructed a hardness dataset containing 13 elements. Based on this, we utilize a two-stage design strategy combining genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to develop multi-component high-entropy alloys. The first stage explores the alloy system and the second stage optimizes the component ratios, thereby promoting innovation and performance enhancement. Our analysis combines SHAP feature significance and Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs), complemented by materials domain knowledge, to validate the findings and guide the selection of alloy systems. In the end, we successfully designed three high-entropy alloys that differed from the existing dataset and predicted an average relative hardness error of less than 5%, with the optimal alloy being only 38 HV lower than the historical record.</span>

Physical unclonable function (PUF) labels, which are random patterns generated by a stochastic process, are an effective anti-counterfeiting strategy due to the inherent randomness of their physical patterns. In this study, a high-throughput droplet array generation technique based on surface tension constraints was developed for the preparation of chalcogenide crystal films with controllable shapes and sizes. The texture of PUF labels is constructed by utilizing the random distribution of chalcogenide nanocrystal grains. Compared with other anti-counterfeiting labels, the labels in this study not only have fluorescent properties, but also have micrometer size, low cost, and high encoding capacity, which provide support for multilevel anti-counterfeiting protection. In addition, this study introduces an innovative PUF recognition method based on Partial Convolutional Network (PaCoNet), which effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods in terms of recognition accuracy and speed. Experimental validation of a dataset of chalcocite nanocrystal films containing up to 60 different macro shapes and unique micro textures shows that the method in this study achieves recognition accuracy of up to 99.65% and significantly reduces the recognition time per image to only 0.177 seconds, highlighting the potential application of these tags in the field of anti-counterfeiting.</span>

Current academic database tools mainly focus on mining textual information, ignoring the valuable information presented in graphs and charts. Extracting information from a large amount of literature can help researchers quickly grasp the current state of development. Literature is a carrier of many forms of data, and most researchers focus only on textual content. Especially, like graphs, they contain a lot of key numerical information that is not expressed in other data. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting information from graphs in the literature. With this method, the numerical values and axis entities of curved graphs can be extracted from both graphs and text. Firstly, the curved graphs are cut out from the literature using Yolov5s. Then, the exact title text corresponding to each curve graph is matched by manipulating Sentence-Bert. After obtaining the title text, the X-axis and Y-axis names in the curve graphs were extracted using SCI-Bert. At the same time, techniques such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to automatically parse the numerical data reflected on the graphs. In addition, a number of principles are used to improve performance. We validated each step using a dataset of 6042 articles from Elsevier. With our method, the accuracy of graph detection and title matching are 96.4% and 95.8% respectively, which are both better than the initial model, proving the effectiveness of our method. The accuracy of entity and numerical data extraction is 76.3% and 28.2%, respectively. The experimental results show that our method is able to achieve large-scale knowledge extraction of curve diagrams from the literature.</span>
