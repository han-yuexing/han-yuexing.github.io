  		<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A context-aware literature information extraction method is proposed based on the expression characteristics of material literature texts and the structural features of component tables, which mines both text and table information. Named entity recognition (NER) technology is used to mine material texts by fusing dynamic word vectors with static word vectors in the material field, so that each word vector contains contextual information and material domain knowledge, significantly improving the NER effect of material texts. Experiments were conducted on NER datasets of stainless steel materials and inorganic materials. 

Regarding the structural characteristics of component tables in material literature, a table recognition method based on traditional image technology is proposed by combining morphological, target contour detection, and text similarity methods. The structure of the component table is broken down into a title, a table header, and a table body, and material names, elements, element contents, and unit information are extracted from different regions. Experimental results showed that the component table recognition method can achieve good performance.</span>
  		<br/>
  		<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A material performance prediction method based on literature information extraction is proposed to predict the tensile strength and material composition data obtained from the context of material literature. The method utilizes the XenonPy materials informatics library to expand the feature space of the composition data. Based on the expansion principle, a cross-feature compression and feature selection method is designed to screen for statistically significant element-level features and tensile strength data. Machine learning is then used to train the prediction model on these data. The experiment uses data published by the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan, and the results show that the proposed composition feature processing method can significantly improve the prediction performance of the model.</span>
  		<br/>
  		<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Using stainless steel as a demonstration material, the proposed literature mining and performance prediction methods are applied to 11,058 scientific literature on stainless steel. 2.36 million material entities were extracted from the literature texts, and 7,970 sets of material composition information were extracted from the literature tables. Relevant data were selected, and numerical prediction was performed on the tensile strength. The change trends of corrosion resistance, ductility, strength, and hardness were also predicted.</span>

  		<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduation, Zhang Jiawang joined Huawei Shanghai Research Institute to engage in software development-related work. During his three-year graduate career at Shanghai University, Zhang Jiawang worked hard to enhance his professional knowledge and research abilities. He was fortunate to have met many excellent mentors and friends. We hope that Zhang Jiawang will always remember his original aspirations and mission, overcome all obstacles, and forge ahead on his future path.</span>

			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. She proposed an image enhancement-based method for recognizing the morphology characteristics of thermal barrier coatings. The method consists of three steps: enhancement of pore contours and image denoising, pore removal and crack repair, and crack recognition and length calculation. It can successfully identify cracks in thermal barrier coatings. Additionally, the reasonable use of image filtering and mathematical morphology enhancement methods ensures high integrity and low deviation in crack recognition in thermal barrier coatings. The proposed method can automatically identify cracks in thermal barrier coatings and calculate their lengths. Compared to manual detection, this method provides more precise crack recognition and faster crack length calculation, providing effective assistance to material science researchers in analyzing the microstructure of thermal barrier coatings conveniently and efficiently.。</span>
			<br/>
			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. She designed two software programs for identifying the morphology characteristics of thermal barrier coatings. One software program achieves thermal barrier coating image enhancement and crack skeleton extraction, while the other software program achieves crack recognition and length calculation. The combination of both software programs further improves the speed of analyzing the microstructure of thermal barrier coatings, reducing time and labor costs. Moreover, the software can also process other material images similar to thermal barrier coating images, promoting the research and development of material science.</span>
			<br/>
			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. She proposed a method for material image data augmentation using an improved HP-VAE-GAN. The improved HP-VAE-GAN uses a CBAM module to refine feature mapping and improve the network's feature representation ability. Meanwhile, an additional convolutional block was added to the encoder network to further improve the network's feature extraction ability and eliminate the impact of CBAM insertion on model performance. The generated results show that the proposed HP-VAE-GAN with the CBAM attention mechanism can effectively improve the quality of generated images. The results of classification experiments show that this method achieves better results than using HP-VAE-GAN for data augmentation, providing a new data augmentation approach for small sample material image datasets.</span>

				<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Extraction of Numerical Chart Information: A combined image and text-based literature mining method was proposed for extracting information from numerical charts along with their corresponding titles. The method involves several steps. Firstly, Yolov5s is utilized to extract individual numerical chart images from scientific literature, and an improved scientific literature image detection method is employed to enhance accuracy. Next, the PDFminer tool is used to parse the textual content from the scientific literature. The cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity between sentences are calculated to match the textual titles corresponding to the numerical charts. The Sci-Bert model and CRF algorithm are then applied to identify axis names in the titles. Additionally, techniques such as morphological operations and character recognition are used to extract specific data information from the numerical chart images. Finally, the extracted axis names and data are integrated to obtain complete numerical chart information. </span>
			<br/>
			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In order to address the low accuracy issue in recognizing axis names of numerical charts mentioned above, this study focuses on the relationship between numerical chart images and text in scientific literature and proposes a method to improve recognition performance. The method starts by identifying label text on the numerical chart image and filling it into a sample template to generate unlabeled text data, effectively achieving data augmentation. Additionally, text similarity matching techniques are employed to search for corresponding statements describing the numerical charts in the body of the scientific literature. These statements are then concatenated with the title text to expand the textual context, improving the vector representation of the generated input sentences. This optimization aims to enhance the predictive performance of the model.</span>

The structure and orientation information of crystals can be obtained by analyzing the Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) patterns, which are acquired through EBSD devices. The reliability and accuracy of the obtained information depend on the precise localization of EBSD pattern bands and intersection points. In this research, a method is proposed that combines Radon transform and cumulative probability Hough transform to achieve automatic localization of EBSD patterns (Chirikov bands) and intersection points. Experimental results demonstrate that this method is robust and capable of detecting more accurate Chirikov bands and intersection points. </span>

To address the challenge of balancing annotation cost and segmentation accuracy in material image segmentation tasks and achieve real-time segmentation models, a material image segmentation algorithm based on interactive drawing annotation and machine learning is designed.

It involves extracting neighborhood features around the center points of material images and performing multiple rounds of interactive drawing annotation. An incremental learning approach is utilized to train the final image segmentation model. This approach enables the model to continuously improve and adapt to new data while minimizing the annotation effort required.</span>

A novel dual-branch network architecture is designed, and a new context feature discrepancy supervision loss is proposed to generate pseudo-labels. This allows the model to achieve high segmentation accuracy using only training images annotated with scribbles. This method addresses the challenges of small sample sizes, annotation difficulties, and resource wastage during testing in deep learning neural networks for material image segmentation tasks.</span>

			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Due to the rapid nature of phase transformations and the complex morphology of lamellar martensite, traditional studies based on martensite images struggle to provide sufficient information during the phase transformation process. In this research, a novel video processing method is proposed to extract and analyze information data from videos depicting the transformation of lamellar martensite. The analysis of image data provides the following dynamic information about the transformation of lamellar martensite: the number of transformations, maximum length, maximum width, average length, average width, area, and category orientation. This study breaks the limitations of studying martensite based on static images and comprehensively describes various data and information related to the dynamic transformation of martensite.</span>

  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development and integration of multiple disciplines, the fusion of computer vision and materials science has greatly transformed conventional material research methods. Existing methods can effectively segment images of specific scenes, but there is no universal approach to accurately segment and analyze material images. To address the challenges of complex textures, blurry boundaries, and low contrast in material images, we propose a method that relies on multi-dimensional feature fusion to more effectively train networks with limited and available annotated samples. This architecture consists of an encoder, graph attention module, multi-scale feature fusion module, and decoder. We demonstrate that such a network can be trained end-to-end from images. In electron microscopy images, the segmentation results outperform many previous state-of-the-art methods. With this approach, we can accurately identify multiple structures in material images, providing valuable insights for multi-stage segmentation of material images and exploring new mechanisms for structural transformations in materials science.</span>

			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We proposed a material image segmentation method based on graph convolution and deep learning to address the challenges of small sample sizes and complex textures in material images. This method incorporates residual connections and multi-scale fusion modules to enrich the information in feature maps. It also utilizes a dual attention mechanism based on graph convolution to enhance the focus on crucial features. Additionally, convolution layers in the deconvolutional part are added to improve the network's non-linear expressive power. </span>
			<br/>
			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To address the issue of feature loss when using excessive convolutional layers on small sample datasets, we designed a graph attention module based on skip connections using UNet as the backbone network. This method combines the ideas of convolutional neural networks and connects graph convolution and graph attention layers. It aims to fuse multi-dimensional node features from a graph structure perspective. By deepening the network while reducing the loss of pixel-level and spatial information, the goal is to improve the segmentation performance of the network.</span>
			<br/>
			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. We implemented the cross-domain application of graph convolution techniques in semantic segmentation tasks. We proposed a graph encoder and graph decoder that transform feature maps into a graph structure. This transformation allows the feature maps generated during the convolution process to be converted into a graph structure with a corresponding number of nodes. This approach facilitates the application of graph convolutional neural networks in semantic segmentation tasks.</span>

  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of materials depends not only on their composition but also on their microstructure under various processing conditions. So far, the analysis of complex microstructural images has heavily relied on human expertise, lacking automated and quantitative characterization methods. Machine learning provides an emerging and essential tool for intelligently identifying various complex material phases. In this work, we propose a "Center-Environment Segmentation" (CES) feature model for image segmentation, which leverages machine learning techniques to segment images using annotated environmental features and domain knowledge.
The CES model introduces neighborhood information as features for a given pixel, reflecting the relationships between the pixel of interest and its surrounding environment. An iterative ensemble machine learning approach is then employed to train and refine the image segmentation model. The CES model has been successfully applied to segment images of seven different materials with complex textures, including steel, wood, and others. In the study of steel image segmentation, the CES method demonstrates superior overall performance in determining boundary contours compared to many traditional methods.
This work demonstrates that the iterative incorporation of domain knowledge and environmental features can enhance the accuracy of segmenting various complex material microstructure images.</span>

Faced with complex material images with uneven distribution and overlapping structures, a research study was conducted on feature information processing methods based on complex network theory. This method utilizes the community structure in complex networks to describe different organizations within the material.

			<span class="word" style="font-weight:bold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the graduate period, Yang Shen worked on the following projects:</span>
			<br/>
  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the challenges of small sample sizes, imbalanced data distributions, and complex textures in material images, a combination of various deep learning techniques was employed to automate the segmentation of microstructures in material images. This approach aimed to provide a data foundation for the construction of material gene databases.。</span>
  			<br/>
			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To address the issue of small sample sizes in material image segmentation, a method combining deep learning and superpixels is proposed. This method takes advantage of the high similarity of pixels within the same material region and utilizes a superpixel algorithm to obtain rectangular blocks, effectively addressing the problem of small sample sizes in material images.

An improved version of DenseNet is introduced, which incorporates a feature enhancement module to preserve texture features while removing interference from redundant features. Additionally, a designed transition layer upsampling method is employed to effectively restore the information of feature maps.

By leveraging the characteristics of superpixels and the enhanced DenseNet, the proposed method achieves accurate and robust segmentation of material images, even when faced with limited sample sizes. The preservation of texture features and the effective recovery of feature map information contribute to the overall segmentation performance, enabling better analysis and understanding of material microstructures.</span>
  			<br/>
  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. 针对材料图像中数据分布不平衡的问题，使用并改进两种损失函数，针对分类任务中数据分布不平衡问题，基于 Focal 损失提出 Precison Foca 损 失，将置信度替换为精度，更准确的反映样本分类的难度，并反馈给网络，优化训练过程；针对分割任务中的数据分布不平衡的问题，基于 Dice 损失提出 CE-Dice 损失，CE-Dice 损失结合交叉熵损失和 Dice 损失，训练过程更平滑，优化分割结果。2. To tackle the issue of imbalanced data distributions in material image segmentation, two types of loss functions are used and improved:

a) Precision Focal Loss for Classification: In addressing the imbalanced data distribution in classification tasks, an improvement is made by proposing the Precision Focal Loss. This loss function replaces confidence with precision, providing a more accurate reflection of the difficulty of sample classification. The difficulty information is then fed back to the network to optimize the training process. By emphasizing hard-to-classify samples, the Precision Focal Loss helps the network focus on learning from challenging instances, leading to improved performance in imbalanced datasets.
b) CE-Dice Loss for Segmentation: For addressing the imbalanced data distribution in segmentation tasks, the CE-Dice Loss is introduced based on two components: the cross-entropy (CE) loss and the Dice loss. By combining these two loss functions, the CE-Dice Loss provides a smoother training process and optimization of the segmentation results. The cross-entropy loss helps with accurate pixel-wise classification, while the Dice loss evaluates the overlap between the predicted and ground truth segmentation masks, encouraging better boundary localization and segmentation accuracy.
The utilization of these improved loss functions aids in mitigating the effects of imbalanced data distributions in both classification and segmentation tasks within material image analysis. By incorporating the specific difficulties and characteristics of these tasks, the proposed loss functions contribute to more effective and accurate training, resulting in better performance and more reliable segmentation outcomes.</span>
			<br/>
			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The precise segmentation of material images with complex textures has been achieved through the following approaches:
In Chapter 3, an improved version of DenseNet is proposed. This modified DenseNet architecture aims to preserve crucial texture features while removing redundant features that can interfere with the identification of rectangular blocks. By incorporating a feature enhancement module, the network can effectively retain important texture information and improve the accuracy of segmentation. The modified DenseNet architecture provides a robust framework for handling material images with complex textures.
In Chapter 4, an improved Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is introduced to achieve accurate segmentation of material images with similar textures. The improved FCN incorporates several modules to enhance segmentation performance. A cascaded feature fusion module combines high-level and low-level semantic features to capture multi-scale information effectively. A multi-scale learning module is employed to delve into fine-grained details and global contextual information. An attention mechanism module is used to focus on important feature maps and optimize resource allocation. These three modules complement each other and work together to improve the accuracy and robustness of texture-based material image segmentation.
By implementing these advancements in DenseNet and FCN architectures, the research has successfully achieved precise segmentation of material images with complex textures. These improvements address the challenges posed by intricate textures, redundant features, and the need for multi-scale information, leading to more accurate and reliable segmentation results in material image analysis.</span>

These characteristics have posed limitations on the development of deep learning methods in the field of material image processing. In this study, we propose Graph-UNet, which combines the UNet architecture with graph convolutional neural networks to address the challenge of automatic segmentation of small-sample material images. We transfer the ideas of multidimensional feature fusion and skip connections from convolutional neural networks to graph convolutional neural networks, enabling an effective combination of graph convolutions and graph attention. Additionally, we establish a versatile module to facilitate the conversion between feature maps and graph structures.

Comparative and ablation experiments were conducted on material image datasets, demonstrating that Graph-UNet outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation results. It accurately identifies various material structures, thereby advancing the exploration of the relationship between material structure and performance.</span>

  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the economic losses caused by counterfeit and pirated products have been increasing, and counterfeit techniques continue to advance. As a result, the issue of anti-counterfeiting detection has attracted widespread attention from researchers. To address the challenges of high computational complexity, resource consumption, and lengthy detection time in existing anti-counterfeiting detection methods, this work proposes a lightweight network-based model for anti-counterfeiting label recognition and detection.

The model utilizes lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNN) for shape and texture recognition. To enhance the model's learning capability in shape recognition tasks, the pooling layer size is reduced. For texture classification tasks, a coordinate attention (CA) module is employed to enhance the model's information retrieval from individual feature maps. The model's ability to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit samples is reinforced through the design of a loss function. Finally, the prediction results are obtained by selecting the maximum value from the feature vectors.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an overall accuracy rate of 95.67% in label recognition and detection. Moreover, the detection time is significantly improved compared to traditional methods.</span>

  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today's ongoing pandemic situation, wearing masks has become a common practice during outings, which obstructs the nose and mouth regions of the face. Additionally, common facial occlusion scenarios include wearing sunglasses, hats, or objects casting shadows on the face. Facial occlusion poses challenges for facial expression recognition. In this paper, based on three common facial occlusion scenarios, namely upper-face occlusion, lower-face occlusion, and eye occlusion, we propose a path selection-based multi-network structure. The method consists of two parts: the first part involves a multi-network structure, where the original dataset is divided into three subsets based on labels, referred to as sub-datasets. Each sub-dataset inherits some labels from the original dataset and is used to train three corresponding sub-networks. The second part is a path selection-based multi-network integration method, where images from each sub-dataset, treated as the same label, are combined into a new dataset for training an initial network. The final prediction is obtained by selecting one of the sub-networks based on the prediction output of the initial network. In this study, the Fer2013, Jaffe, KDEF, and RAF-DB datasets, commonly used for facial expression recognition, are merged into a larger dataset to increase the training sample size and simulate occlusion scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively recognizes facial expressions under occlusion and is applicable to various facial occlusion scenarios, enabling more accurate and reliable facial expression recognition in a wide range of real-world applications. </span>

  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the drawbacks of manual detection of morphology features in hot barrier coatings, such as complexity and high error rates, we propose a method for automatically recognizing morphology features of hot barrier coatings and calculating their parameters using machine vision. We have achieved automatic contour extraction based on mathematical morphology and calculated the spreading morphology parameters. The method utilizes the maximum interclass variance method to determine the threshold for binary segmentation. Mean filtering and morphological operations are applied to denoise the images while preserving the connectivity of individual layers. Contour extraction is performed to obtain the edge information of each layer, and then the solidity parameter of each layer is calculated based on the extracted contours.

Additionally, we have further developed an automatic identification and length calculation method for cracks in hot barrier coatings using a traversal search approach. First, the layers in the image are identified and removed, and the fractures in the cracks are repaired using a closing operation. The crack skeleton is obtained through image thinning. Then, each individual crack is traversed and its length is calculated.

The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects layer contours and identifies cracks with good resistance to noise interference. It accurately calculates morphology feature parameters and plays a significant role in studying the deposition behavior of thermal spray droplets on substrate surfaces.</span>

  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material images often lack a sufficient number of training samples, which hinders the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in material image analysis. In this study, we leverage an important characteristic of material images, namely the high similarity among pixels of the same phase, and propose a method for recognizing and segmenting the microstructure of material images based on superpixel algorithms and deep learning. The method consists of three steps:

1. Rectangular block extraction: Initially, we employ a classic superpixel algorithm, such as SLIC, to obtain different numbers of superpixels. Then, we extract the largest inscribed rectangular block within each superpixel.

2. Rectangular block recognition: We input these rectangular blocks into a convolutional neural network (CNN), with DenseNet chosen and enhanced as the backbone network for recognition. Additionally, considering the issues of non-uniform phase distribution and difficulty in distinguishing certain phases in material images, we select and improve the Focal loss to adapt to material images.

3. Pixel-level prediction and segmentation: Finally, we predict the class labels for each pixel in the entire image. After training, we slide a window of size l*l (l is an odd number) with a stride of 1 over the n*n-sized image, obtaining n*n rectangular blocks. The model predicts the class labels for these rectangular blocks, representing the class labels of the pixels in the middle of each block. By connecting pixels of the same class label, we achieve the recognition and segmentation of the microstructure in material images.</span>

The reliability and accuracy of the obtained information depend on the precise localization of the EBSD pattern bands and intersection points. In this study, we propose a method for automatically obtaining the positions of EBSD pattern (Kikuchi band) and intersection points.

The method utilizes the Radon transform and cumulative probability Hough transform to detect the lines and line segments representing the edges of Kikuchi bands. Subsequently, the Kikuchi bands can be approximated by fitting hyperbolic curves to the endpoints of the line segments. These results provide a quantitative description of the Kikuchi bands' information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and capable of detecting more accurate Kikuchi bands and intersection points.

By automating the localization of EBSD pattern bands and intersection points, our method enhances the reliability and accuracy of the obtained crystal structure and orientation information. It offers a robust and effective approach for analyzing EBSD patterns and extracting valuable data for crystallographic studies.</span>

On the afternoon of December 16th, Professor Han Yuexing delivered a presentation titled "Material Image Processing Methods Based on Computer Vision." He described several methods for extracting information from material image data.

Material data serves as the foundation of the Materials Genome Initiative and plays a crucial role in constructing various databases related to material research. It also aids in the understanding of the relationships between "microstructure," "manufacturing processes," and "macroscopic properties" for artificial intelligence. Material data primarily consists of computational data, experimental data, production data, and literature data, with a significant amount of images often included within these datasets. Extracting key information from these images is a primary objective of material image processing.</span><br>                 
				 <span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presentation mainly described the use of computer vision methods, including machine learning and deep learning techniques, to extract and analyze various elements within complex material images. Three specific examples were discussed:

1. Recognition of DNA macromolecules in images of molecular robots: This example focused on using computer vision methods to identify and recognize DNA macromolecules in images of molecular robots. By applying machine learning algorithms, the system can automatically extract and analyze the structures and patterns of DNA molecules, contributing to the understanding and design of molecular machines.

2. Segmentation and recognition of Kikuchi patterns: The second example involved the segmentation and recognition of Kikuchi patterns. By employing image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms, the system can accurately identify and segment Kikuchi patterns, which are essential for analyzing crystal structures and orientations.

3. Material image segmentation using superpixels and improved DenseNet: The third example discussed material image segmentation using a combination of superpixels and an improved DenseNet method. By utilizing superpixels to group image regions and incorporating an enhanced DenseNet architecture, the system can effectively segment materials in images, providing valuable insights for material analysis and characterization.

  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to assist doctors in making comprehensive assessments and plans for tumor patients, automated segmentation of the liver and tumors in CT images is performed using various deep learning techniques. This provides a data foundation for quantitative and qualitative diagnosis, facilitating clinical treatment. Automated segmentation of the liver and tumors using a combination of deep learning techniques allows doctors to obtain comprehensive evaluations and treatment plans for tumor patients. This automated approach alleviates the workload on doctors and improves the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. By utilizing deep learning algorithms, the system can learn and recognize the features of the liver and tumors in CT images, accurately segmenting them. Such segmentation results can be used for quantitative and qualitative assessments, aiding in clinical decision-making.</span>

A boundary loss-based 2.5D fully convolutional network (FCN) is proposed to address the limitations of FCN, U-Net, and other deep learning methods in exploring spatial feature information in three-dimensional CT images. This novel approach effectively explores the spatial feature information in CT images while reducing the network parameters and computational resource consumption. The proposed method enhances the accuracy of liver and liver tumor segmentation.</span>

To address the characteristics of medical images and the limited capability of common loss functions to optimize network exploration of boundary features, a new boundary loss function is designed. This novel loss function combines the distance, area, and boundary information of image contours, effectively optimizing deep learning networks to explore more image boundary and contour features.</span>

			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. To address the issue of encoding-decoding networks ignoring the correlation and dependency among local features, a segmentation framework based on dual-path attention is proposed by integrating 2D, 2.5D, and 3D networks with attention mechanisms. This framework incorporates dual-path self-attention modules, dense network blocks, residual network blocks, and dual-path network blocks. It comprises nine different network structures and is capable of effectively performing automated segmentation of liver and tumor CT images. The integration of these components allows the network to capture and leverage both local and global information, leading to improved segmentation accuracy.</span>

  			<span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the rapid development of nanoscience and nanotechnology in various fields, the high cost associated with obtaining a sufficient number of nano-object samples remains a challenge, impeding the advancement of deep learning methods in the materials domain. To address this issue, we have designed a novel method for identifying nano-objects in atomic force microscopy (AFM) images.

Firstly, we employ a LOG-based image denoising technique for preprocessing the images. Then, we propose two improved methods for segmenting overlapping objects based on the watershed algorithm. Finally, we establish a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) recognition model. This model achieves excellent performance by pretraining on large-scale datasets of handwritten digits and letter shapes, enabling the identification of nano-objects in AFM images.

The method proposed in this study effectively tackles the challenge of identifying nano-objects in AFM images, where the availability of small-sample nano-objects is limited.</span>

			     <span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep learning has been widely successful in various image classification tasks. However, its application to EEG (Electroencephalogram) motor imagery signal classification has been limited. In this study, we propose a preprocessing algorithm for representing EEG signals, followed by a parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN) architecture for classifying motor imagery signals.

For the representation of raw EEG signals, a novel form of image is created to combine spatial filtering and frequency band extraction. By inputting the represented images into the PCNN, it stacks three unique sub-models together, aiming to optimize the classification performance.

The proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 83.0±3.4% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b, surpassing the compared methods by at least 5.2%. The average Kappa value of this method on Dataset 2b reaches 0.659±0.067, exhibiting at least a 20.5% improvement compared to the compared algorithms. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in classifying motor imagery signals in EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

In this work, we demonstrate the capability of combining machine learning (ML) image segmentation techniques with HTP synthesis and characterization for the discovery of new thermoelectric compounds. 

First, cylindrical samples with nine different compositions were synthesized using an improved diffusion couple HTP synthesis method. Subsequently, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization was performed on fixed fragments of each composition, resulting in the acquisition of 11 backscattered electron (BSE) images per fragment (99 images in total). To rapidly segment the different phases in the 99 BSE images, we propose two ML image segmentation strategies: a supervised active learning strategy utilizing a fully connected neural network and an unsupervised clustering strategy. 

The supervised strategy significantly reduces the time cost of image segmentation, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.9. This model is then used for automatic segmentation of a large batch of images. To further reduce the workload of manual annotation, active learning is introduced during the training process. Analyzing the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) characterization of the two major phases separated by the first strategy, we discovered a new compound, Cu7Sn3S10, which exhibits promising thermoelectric properties with a zT value exceeding 0.6. 

In contrast to the supervised strategy, the unsupervised strategy allows for the identification of compounds that may have been overlooked in the BSE images without manual annotation. Based on the results of the unsupervised strategy, we discovered an unreported compound, Cu1.6S. Overall, our work showcases an example of a fully HTP workflow, enabling automated analysis of HTP characterization and new compound identification.

			     <span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counterfeit products, ranging from high-end luxury goods to medical supplies, not only cause significant economic losses but also pose a significant threat to people's health. The currently widely used anti-counterfeiting labels are based on deterministic production processes, which are simple to replicate for counterfeiters. Developing anti-counterfeiting labels with physical unclonable functions (PUFs) is a feasible solution. However, traditional PUF recognition techniques require matching against all images in a database, resulting in high production costs and slow identification speed.</span><br>  
           <span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the aforementioned issues, the research team utilized high-throughput parallel non-continuous dewetting technology to fabricate a multifunctional label with four layers of anti-counterfeiting capabilities. 
The first layer of anti-counterfeiting is achieved through the fluorescence of perovskite crystal films. These films exhibit unique fluorescence properties that can be used for authentication. The second layer of anti-counterfeiting involves macroscopic patterns composed of basic units, such as QR codes, which can carry information and serve as additional security features.
The third layer of anti-counterfeiting is based on microscale basic units with diverse shapes. These units provide an additional level of security as their distinct shapes can be difficult to replicate.
The fourth layer of anti-counterfeiting is achieved through the use of non-reproducible textures formed through self-assembly processes. These random textures create a unique and unclonable pattern, further enhancing the security of the label. By combining these four layers of anti-counterfeiting features, the research team has developed a label that offers enhanced security and counterfeit prevention across multiple levels.</span><br>  
           <span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main work involved designing and establishing a database that stores authentic thin film patterns, which includes shape and texture databases. For shape recognition, we employed the CNL (Control the Number of Landmarks) method, an improved Hough Transform method, and shape space theory. These techniques were utilized to accurately identify the shapes present in the labels.
Subsequently, we utilized the GMS (Grid-based Motion Statistics) method to further recognize the textures of the labels. This method leverages grid-based analysis and motion statistics to effectively identify and differentiate the unique textures embedded in the labels.
By combining the shape recognition techniques and texture identification using GMS, our research team has developed a comprehensive approach for the recognition and authentication of the labels based on their shape and texture characteristics.。</span><br>  
           <span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practical applications, anti-counterfeiting micro-patterns are captured using smartphones or portable microscopes and then fed into recognition software for matching and identification. The various contour shapes of the nanocrystal films are refined and classified, serving as "classification symbols" for image data recognition. By employing this "divide and conquer" strategy in the recognition process, the verification time can be reduced by more than 20 times.
Combining high-throughput materials fabrication techniques with data-driven material applications, our approach achieves low reagent costs (2.1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> USD), simple and fast authentication (total time of 12.17 seconds), and high coding capacity (2.1 × 10<sup>623</sup>).
This integration of advanced technologies enables cost-effective and efficient anti-counterfeiting measures, providing a robust solution with high coding capacity and fast authentication for a wide range of applications.</span><br>      
           <span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The related work has received funding from various sources, including:

1. National Key Research and Development Program (2020YFB0704503, 2018YFB0704400, 2018YFB0704402): These programs are part of the national strategic research initiative that supports key research and development projects in China.

2. National Natural Science Foundation of China (21775101): This foundation provides funding for basic and applied research in various scientific disciplines.

4. Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission Project (20ZR1419000): This project is funded by the Shanghai municipal government to support research and development activities in the city.

The support from these funding sources has played a crucial role in facilitating the progress and success of the research work in developing innovative anti-counterfeiting technologies and materials.</span><br>

			    <span class="word">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hall-Petch relationship provides a quantitative description of the relationship between grain size and yield strength in polycrystalline materials. However, there are various statistical methods for determining grain size, such as intercept method, matching method, and grid method. Additionally, concepts of grain size can be represented by parameters such as equivalent circle diameter and grain perimeter. Investigating the geometric characteristics of grains that have the highest correlation with yield strength in polycrystalline materials requires image and big data processing.

This study combines image processing and machine learning techniques to construct the relationship between geometric characteristics of magnesium alloy grains and yield strength.

                      <span class="STYLE3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To analyze and solve typical small-sample problems in materials, the following approaches can be used to handle and analyze three different types of small-sample data. Targeted solutions for small-sample problems can be developed using relevant theoretical knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, and complex networks.</span><br>
                      <span class="STYLE3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A machine learning-based method for crystal structure recognition has been proposed to address data related to crystal structures. This method involves augmenting the sample data and defining feature representations and feature selection based on the distribution characteristics of atoms in space. Finally, machine learning techniques are utilized to achieve crystal structure recognition.

This method involves preprocessing the images to remove noise and improving the watershed segmentation technique for segmenting overlapping objects. Finally, transfer learning is utilized to recognize the target objects.</span><br>
                      <span class="STYLE3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. A complex network theory-based image segmentation method is proposed for microscopic structure images of ceramics. This method generates a set of nodes in network space based on the pixel value distribution of the image. It then defines the similarity between nodes and generates a network topology structure. Finally, it optimizes the network topology structure and performs image segmentation.</span></td>
